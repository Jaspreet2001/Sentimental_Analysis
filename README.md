# Social-Media-Sentiment-Analysis-Using-Machine-Learning
A Machine Learning Model to analyse the nature of tweets and classify them as Positive/Negative.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
here's a concise step-by-step breakdown in points for building a sentiment analysis model for social media using machine learning:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Data Collection:
-----------------
Access social media APIs (e.g., Twitter API via Tweepy) to gather tweets or text data.
Collect labeled data (positive/negative sentiment) or label the data manually.

Data Preprocessing:
-------------------
Clean the text data by removing special characters, punctuation, URLs, and stopwords.
Tokenize the text into words or phrases.
Normalize text by converting to lowercase and applying techniques like stemming or lemmatization.

Feature Engineering:
--------------------
Convert the preprocessed text into numerical representations suitable for machine learning models.
Utilize techniques like Bag-of-Words, TF-IDF, or Word Embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe) to create feature vectors.

Model Selection and Training:
-----------------------------
Choose a machine learning algorithm (e.g., Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, Random Forests) or deep learning model (e.g., LSTM, CNN).
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Train the selected model using the training dataset.

Model Evaluation:
-----------------
Evaluate the trained model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on the testing dataset.
Fine-tune hyperparameters or consider different models to improve performance.

Prediction and Analysis:
------------------------
Use the trained model to predict sentiments (positive/negative) for new or unseen social media text.
Analyze predictions to understand sentiment trends or patterns in the data.

Iterative Improvement:
---------------------
Iterate on preprocessing steps, feature engineering, and model selection to enhance accuracy.
Consider additional data augmentation techniques or advanced NLP methods for improvement.

Deployment and Application:
--------------------------
Deploy the trained model for real-time sentiment analysis on social media data.
Integrate the model into applications, dashboards, or tools for automated sentiment monitoring.
